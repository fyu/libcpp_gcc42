This is the libc++ implementation of standard C++ library shipped with
Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. This perticular implementation also support gcc
4.2 shipped with Mac OS X. However, in Mac OS X 10.8, gcc 4.2 can no
longer compile the default libc++. Therefore, this library is pulled
out in case that combination of gcc4.2 with libc++ is needed in the
future.
